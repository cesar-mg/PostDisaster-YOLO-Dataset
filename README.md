**Building Damage Detection using YOLOv8 and Satellite Imagery**  

This repository hosts the dataset used in the research **"Toward Reliable Post-Disaster Assessment: Advancing Building Damage Detection using YOLO CNN and Satellite Imagery."** The dataset includes **high-resolution satellite imagery from the Maxar GeoEye-1 satellite**, along with corresponding annotations, preprocessing scripts, and training configurations.

## 📌 Overview
Natural disasters, particularly **hydrometeorological events**, pose significant threats to populations worldwide, especially in developing countries with **limited disaster response budgets**. Rapid and efficient damage assessment is crucial for **saving lives and optimizing resource allocation**. This research explores **YOLOv8** models trained with various optimization functions, demonstrating that **SGD outperforms Adam in stabilizing training and improving prediction confidence**.

## 📂 Dataset Contents
- **Satellite Images:** High-resolution imagery from the Maxar GeoEye-1 satellite.
- **Annotations:** Bounding boxes for building damage classification.
